- The stock is currently one of the best peprforming sectors in the market and well above its 20-day and 50 day moving averages. This particular stock has been in a consistent uptrend all year long, even before the sector was popular

The next earnings release is not until December, so the plan is to follow the uptrend

### Target: 
`$`price and follow trend from there

### Entry:
current levels are ok as long as current price remains aboce the 20 day sma this week

### Stop: 
`%` loss acceptable or earlier if market or sector is going down.

### Time frame:
stay in the trade until first target is reached or continue with trend and choose a second target

### Sizing:
Since there is no earnings conflict, full size risk. (1 to 2 percent or higher if want to keep portfolio smaller)

### Strategy: 
this is the options strategy, not used for traiding short or long stocks, but an example would be: IV is 20 percent so straight call option. (self note: need to learn more about options before using this.)
- uptrend
- pulled back to sma and rebound
- sector still up
- market still up

    maximum cost / risk with no stop: $risk
    maximum gain: Unlimited / $gain
    based on strong trend $target price target makes sense
